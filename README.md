## Introduction:

Air pollution is a major environmental issue that has a significant impact on the health of humans and other living organisms. This repository contains an analysis of air pollution levels in various Indian cities based on the Air Quality Index (AQI). The data set used for this analysis contains AQI values for 26 cities in India.

## Objective:

The objective of this analysis is to identify the cities with the highest and lowest levels of air pollution in India. The analysis will help us to understand the severity of the problem and the measures that can be taken to reduce air pollution.

## Data:

The data set used for this analysis is a CSV file containing AQI values for 26 cities in India.


The data set contains the following information:
- Indian_cities: The name of the city
- city_hour: The Air Quality Index value for the city
## Methodology:

The analysis was carried out using Python and the following libraries: pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The data set was imported into a pandas data frame and cleaned to remove any missing values. Exploratory data analysis was carried out to understand the distribution of the AQI values and to identify the cities with the highest and lowest levels of air pollution. The results were visualized using bar charts and scatter plots.

## Results:

The analysis revealed that the city with the highest level of air pollution is Delhi, with an AQI value of 256. The city with the lowest level of air pollution is Aizawl, with an AQI value of 26. The analysis also revealed that the majority of the cities in the data set have AQI values between 70 and 190, indicating a moderate to high level of air pollution.

## Conclusion:

Air pollution is a significant environmental issue that needs to be addressed urgently. The analysis shows that some Indian cities are more severely affected by air pollution than others. The results of this analysis can be used to identify the cities that require immediate attention in terms of air pollution control measures. Further analysis can be carried out to identify the sources of air pollution and to develop effective strategies to reduce air pollution levels.
